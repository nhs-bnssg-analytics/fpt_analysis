### Proportion of resident population within the most and least deprived quintiles

**Source:** [ONS Indices of Deprivation 2019 by LSOA](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d8b3b51ed915d036a455aa6/File_5_-_IoD2019_Scores.xlsx)

**Calculation description:** LSOAs are attributed to deprivation quintile based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) Score. For 2011 to 2020, the population mid-year estimates (based on the 2011 census) for LSOAs are summed to Integrated Care System (2022) using a lookup stored on the [ONS Geography Portal](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/1ac8547e9a8945478f0b5ea7ffe1a6b1/data).

For 2021 and 2022, the Local Authority District (LAD) populations are used for each of the two years. For each age band within each LAD, the proportion of the LAD population within each LSOA is calculated using the 2020 mid-year estimates, and these proportions are applied to the 2021 and 2022 LAD populations. The populations are then summed to ICS geographies using the lookup above.

## Capacity data

### Workforce Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) in acute settings per 10,000 population

**Numerator:** Estimated FTEs in acute settings in each ICS for the month nearest to July each year.

**Numerator source:** [NHS Workforce Statistics](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-workforce-statistics).

**Calculation details:** The csv file for the month closest to July are downloaded, and the csv file with the Staff Group and Organisation information is used. From this file, the FTEs are used for the calculation. Only the "Acute" Cluster Group is used, along with the "Total" Staff Grade. Other Cluster Groups are removed because the data quality is less reliable (for example, Ambulance Cluster Group attribute all FTEs to where the regional headquarters of the Ambulatory Service is located - this appears to be the case for Mental Health and Community Services Cluster Group too).

Each organisations FTE value is applied to an ICS using the trust to ICS estimation method described in the [trust to ICS weighting section](#catchment-weighting).

**Denominator:** Total registered population within General Practices in July each year.

**Denominator source:** [NHS Patients registered at a GP Practice](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/patients-registered-at-a-gp-practice)

### Full Time Equivalent days sick per 10,000 population

These indicators are calculated for acute and mental health settings.

**Numerator:** Full-time equivalent sick days.

**Numerator source:** [NHS ESR Sickness Absence](https://files.digital.nhs.uk/A6/67E0C1/ESR_ABSENCE_CSV_NHSE.csv) for April 2009 to March 2022.

-   NHS Trust

The proportions described are applied to each month and summed to each quarter to provide a quarterly value. Each quarter is then averaged to calculate an annual value.

**Denominator:** Total registered population within General Practices for each quarter in a year, which is averaged to calculate an annual value.

### Full Time Equivalent days available per 100 population

**Numerator:** See [Sickness Absence numerator details](#sickness-absence-numerator) for information on the numerator for available days.

## Geographical estimation methods

### Trust to ICS estimations {#catchment-weighting}

Many of the publicly available statistics are published for the Trust.

A population weighting method is applied to these statistics based on the published [Acute Trust Catchment Populations](https://app.box.com/s/qh8gzpzeo1firv1ezfxx2e6c4tgtrudl) from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. These data provide an understanding of the proportion of patients that are admitted to each acute trust (by year) from each Middle layer Super Output Area (MSOA) for all types of admissions.

Where an organisation in this dataset has a catchment population published, its values are distributed among the MSOAs in the proportions described by the Trust's catchment populations.

Where an organisation does not have a published catchment population, the two geographically nearest Trusts that do have published catchment populations within each year are identified. The catchments from these trusts are then applied to the unknown organisation's value using a distance weighting (for example, if one trust is twice as near as the other trust, its catchment is weighted twice as strongly compared with the other trust when calculating the catchment for the unknown organisation).
