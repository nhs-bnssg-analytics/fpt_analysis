The data collection is manual, but the input data provided to each model is only selected based on data quality, length and whether the published geography is at a granular enough scale. The metrics provided to the modelling are selected based on whether they provide information on system demand or capacity, and not based on pre-conceived hypotheses of relevance to the output metric being modelled.

Here, we test for different lengths of input data (e.g., testing whether by including more years of data in the model development process it improve its predictive capability).

The “successful” group is the count of cases for each ICS that achieved the performance metrics within the criteria specified. The “unsuccessful” group are the remaining cases. This allows for binomial regression using a generalised linear model using a logit link function.\nRegularisation was performed to enable selection of the final variables to go into the model. Elastic net regularisation was performed (described in the hyperparameter tuning) section), and the important variables were identified.\n\n\nRandom Forest\nThis non-parametric approach allows the full dataset to be randomly sub-sampled (with replacement), along with taking random samples of the predictor variables, to build multiple decision trees. These decision trees get aggregated up to provide a model to use on unseen data.\nA variation of this approach was also tested, where a random forest approach was used in the same way, but to model the change in value of the target variable from the previous year, from the change in values from the predictor variables from the previous year.\n\n\nVariable importance\nPermutation importance was used to provide an indication of which variable influenced the models most. This is performed by shuffling the input data within each column at a time, ten times, and calculating an average of the deterioration in the evaluation metric when assessing the predicted values, using the model, against the observed values in the test dataset.",

    "section": "Pre-processing",
    "text": "Pre-processing\n\nFrequency weights\nA column for frequency weighting is used for the logistic regression only. This column is the total number of cases included in the target variable calculation. For example, if the target variable is the proportion of incomplete referral to treatment pathways that are greater than 18 weeks, the frequency weighting column is the total number of incomplete pathways. The purpose of this column is to ensure downstream processes consider the different weighting of each record in the dataset. Some records account for a much higher volume of cases than others, so they should have more weighting on processes like normalisation than others. These weights impact the pre-processing, the model estimation, and the performance estimation steps.\n\n\nLagging data\nModels were tested with lagged predictor variables. Both one and two year lagging was tested. Conceptually, this was done to determine whether the value of a predictor variable for a previous year has an influence on the target variable for the current year. Testing was also performed where a lagged versions of the target variable was included as a predictor variable.\n\n\nPandemic impact\nThe impact of the pandemic was accommodated for by introducing a variable which quantifies the proportion of occupied beds that have a patient with a COVID19 diagnosis in.\n\n\nSplitting dataset\nBoth of the modelling approaches described have unknown hyperparameters. These can be tuned to optimise the performance of the model. The optimisation process was done by splitting the input dataset into two parts: 80% of the data were selected into a training set and 20% were selected into a test set. This split was done at random, so all ICSs and all years have equal chance of appearing in each set.\n\n\nVariable removal\nVariables are removed manually in three circumstances:\n\nwhere more than 40% of the training set are missing\nwhere more than 95% of the training set are 0\nwhere more than 95% of the test set are missing\n\n\n\nImputing missing variables\nMissing values were imputed for the remaining variables by applying the mean of the five nearest neighbours values, based on all of the other predictor variables in the training data.\n\n\nNormalisation\nFor the logistic regression model, the data are centred and scaled.\n\n\nHyperparameter tuning\nThe training set was split into 7 folds to perform “leave-group-out” cross validation to enable the hyperparameter tuning. Each fold was defined by NHS region and only contained the ICSs in those NHS regions. Models were then trained on 6 of the 7 folds using a variety of hyperparameters, and then validated on the remaining fold to identify the parameters that provided the best performance. The purpose of doing leave-group-out cross validation was to reduce the likelihood that the hyperparameters for the model were tuned on data that is similar in the training and validation sets due to being consecutive years for one ICS (e.g., a specific ICS could have similar inputs in two adjacent years, which, if one year was used for training and the subsequent year used for validation, it could lead to overfitting and promote a model that performs poorly on the test dataset).",

Standardisation of the input data was performed as a separate pre-processing step, as described above, rather than within the glmnet function.\nThe two hyperparameters that were tuned were; the penalty parameter (lambda), which defines the amount of regularisation (e.g., the amount of explanatory variable penalisation that occurs), and the mixture parameter, where a value of 1 is a pure lasso model, and 0 is a pure ridge regression model.\n\n\nRandom forest\nThe random forest model was also specified with the randomForest package.

Some of the demand and capacity metrics are ones that can be influenced by policy and investment. This work should be able to identify significant associations between the demand and capacity metrics and the resulting performance. This will help support high-level prioritisation for investment and policy making. For example, if it can be shown there is a strong relationship between social care funding and reducing No Criteria to Reside patients, this can be used to make a strong case for increasing social care funding, if this will be more than offset by the acute cost saving.",
